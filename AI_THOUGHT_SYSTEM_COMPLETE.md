## Thought Processing Flow

### 1. Event Detection
```typescript
// External event triggers thought
const trigger: ThoughtTrigger = {
  type: 'external_event',
  data: { eventType: 'player_action', details: {...} },
  importance: 8,
  timestamp: Date.now()
};
```

### 2. Thought Routing
```typescript
// System determines thought type and priority
if (trigger.importance >= 8) {
  // Add to immediate queue
  immediateThoughtQueue.add(agentId, trigger);
} else if (trigger.importance >= 5) {
  // Add to scheduled queue
  scheduledThoughtQueue.add(agentId, trigger);
}
```

### 3. Context Assembly
```typescript
// Gather all relevant information
const context = {
  agent: agentData,
  recentMemories: memories,
  relationships: relationships,
  currentActivity: activity,
  trigger: trigger
};
```

### 4. LLM Processing
```typescript
// Generate thought using GPT-4o-mini
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: thoughtPrompt }],
  max_tokens: 300,
  temperature: 0.7
});
```

### 5. Action Execution
```typescript
// Execute determined action
switch (result.action.type) {
  case 'immediate_activity':
    await executeImmediateActivity(agentId, result);
    break;
  case 'schedule_activity':
    await scheduleActivity(agentId, result);
    break;
  case 'modify_goals':
    await modifyGoals(agentId, result);
    break;
}
```

### 6. Memory Storage
```typescript
// Store thought as memory
await storeThought(agentId, thoughtType, result);
```
