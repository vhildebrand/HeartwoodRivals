# AI Behavioral Changes Test Results

## üéØ **Key Discovery: NPCs DO Change Their Behavior**

The AI system **successfully triggers actual behavioral changes** in NPCs based on conversations and events. Here's what we discovered:

---

## ‚úÖ **Immediate Thought System - WORKING**

### **Test 1: Elara's Fire Emergency Response**
**Trigger**: "Fire at the church requires immediate repair tools"
**Result**: Complete behavioral change decision

```json
{
  "decision": "I need to stop forging hooks and gather tools for the church repairs.",
  "action": {
    "type": "immediate_activity",
    "details": {
      "activity": "gathering repair tools",
      "location": "church",
      "reason": "The fire at the church needs urgent attention, and they require tools to repair the damage."
    }
  },
  "reasoning": "The church is an important place for the community. If there's a fire, it could affect many people. I may be shy, but I need to help. This is more than just my work; it's about supporting our town."
}
```

**Key Behavioral Changes**:
- ‚úÖ **Activity Change**: From "forging hooks" ‚Üí "gathering repair tools"
- ‚úÖ **Location Change**: From "blacksmith shop" ‚Üí "church"
- ‚úÖ **Priority Override**: Community emergency overrides personal work
- ‚úÖ **Personality Integration**: Acknowledges being shy but overcomes it for community

### **Test 2: Dr. Helena's Medical Emergency Response**
**Trigger**: "Medical emergency at the docks - someone is badly injured"
**Result**: Professional medical response

```json
{
  "decision": "Proceed immediately to the docks to assess and treat the injured person.",
  "action": {
    "type": "immediate_activity",
    "details": {
      "activity": "provide medical assistance",
      "location": "docks",
      "reason": "A medical emergency has been reported, indicating a person is badly injured and requires immediate care."
    }
  },
  "reasoning": "The urgency of the situation is critical given the report of a serious injury at the docks, which is a common place for maritime accidents. As a physician, my primary responsibility is to address such emergencies swiftly to prevent further harm and provide necessary treatment."
}
```

**Key Behavioral Changes**:
- ‚úÖ **Professional Response**: Medical expertise drives decision-making
