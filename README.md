## 🧠 **AI Systems Deep Dive**

### **Memory System**
```typescript
// NPCs maintain four types of memories:
- Observations: "Player_John entered the blacksmith shop"
- Reflections: "The community seems more interested in my work lately"
- Plans: "I should finish the anchor repair for Captain Finn"
- Metacognition: "My current approach to community engagement is working well"
```

### **Reflection System**
- **Automatic Triggering**: When cumulative memory importance exceeds 150 points
- **Pattern Analysis**: LLM analyzes recent memories for themes and insights
- **Behavioral Integration**: Reflections influence future conversations and actions
- **Example**: Elara reflecting on increased community interest in her blacksmithing

### **Metacognition System**
- **Performance Evaluation**: NPCs assess their progress toward goals
- **Strategy Adjustment**: Modify approaches based on outcomes
- **Opportunity Recognition**: Identify new possibilities from conversations
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Dynamic schedule modification (Sarah's seed example)

### **Planning System**
- **Daily Plan Generation**: LLM creates contextual schedules
- **Goal Alignment**: Plans advance primary and secondary objectives
- **Context Integration**: Considers personality, memories, and current situation
- **Adaptive Execution**: Plans adjust based on interruptions and opportunities
