Technical Design Document

1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical architecture and design for Project Heartwood Valley, a multiplayer 2D simulation game featuring fully autonomous generative agents as NPCs. Drawing from "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior" and "Metacognition is all you need? Using Introspection in Generative Agents to Improve Goal-directed Behavior", this system implements true agentic behavior where NPCs maintain their own schedules, goals, memories, and can interact freely with both players and other NPCs in a persistent small town environment.

The architecture integrates the foundational Memory-Reflection-Planning loop from Generative Agents, the strategic oversight of a Metacognition module, and the cost-saving optimizations of Lifestyle Policies and Social Memory from Affordable Generative Agents.

2. System Architecture Overview

The system is a set of microservices designed to handle the complex lifecycle of an autonomous agent. The Agent Management System acts as the central orchestrator.

Client (Phaser 3): Renders the game and handles user input. Displays autonomous NPC behaviors and interactions.

Game Server (Colyseus): Manages real-time multiplayer state, player positions, NPC positions, and authoritative game events via WebSockets. Coordinates agent actions in the game world.

Web API (Node.js/Express): Handles non-real-time requests like authentication, inventory management, and acts as a secure proxy for all LLM API calls. Manages agent-to-agent communication requests.

Databases:

PostgreSQL: The primary store for persistent data (users, items, relationships, agent profiles, and long-term memories).

Redis: A cache for session data, agent state, active plans, and real-time coordination between agents.

Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate): Stores embeddings of agent memories for efficient semantic retrieval and similarity-based memory access.

LLM Service: An external, third-party API providing the language model for agent reasoning, dialogue, and reflection.

3. Agent Systems Deep Dive

3.1. Agent Management System (The Orchestrator)

Responsibility: The main loop for all agents. It triggers other systems based on the game clock and agent states.

Logic: At each significant time step, it queries for agents needing action. It calls the PlanningSystem to get the next action and sends the command to the GameServer for execution. It triggers the ReflectionSystem and MetacognitionSystem based on timers or events.

3.2. Memory & Retrieval System

Responsibility: Implements the agent's memory stream.

Components:

Observation Ingestion: Receives events from the game world (e.g., "Player entered room") and stores them.

Embedding Service: On memory creation, generates a vector embedding and stores it in the VectorDB.

Storage: Long-term memories (content, importance score) are stored in PostgreSQL. Embeddings are stored in the VectorDB.

Retrieval Function: When queried with a context (e.g., "planning next action"), it fetches relevant memories by combining recency (from Postgres timestamp), importance (from Postgres score), and relevance (from VectorDB cosine similarity search).

3.3. Planning & Reflection Systems

PlanningSystem: Generates and decomposes goals into actionable steps, as described in Generative Agents. It queries the MemorySystem for context before prompting the LLM.

ReflectionSystem: Triggered by the AgentManager (e.g., once per day). It queries the MemorySystem for recent memories and prompts the LLM to generate high-level insights, which are then stored back into memory.

3.4. Metacognition System

Responsibility: Strategic oversight.

Trigger: Activated by the AgentManager when an agent's long-term plan shows little progress over time.

Logic:

Retrieves the agent's goal and a summary of its recent plans and outcomes from the MemorySystem.

Prompts the LLM with a metacognitive question: "Given the goal to 'write a book', and the outcome of 'only writing one page in three days', is the current strategy effective? Propose three alternative strategies."

The output is stored as a powerful metacognitive memory. The AgentManager then triggers the PlanningSystem to create a new plan, heavily weighting the new metacognitive memory.

3.5. Affordability System (The Optimizer)

Responsibility: Intercepts expensive operations and replaces them with cheaper alternatives.

Components:

Lifestyle Policy Cache:

A HASH in Redis: lifestyle_policy:<agent_id>:<routine_name>.

When the PlanningSystem requests a plan for a known routine (e.g., "make breakfast"), the AffordabilitySystem first checks Redis.

If a policy exists, it returns the cached action sequence directly.

If not, it allows the PlanningSystem to proceed. On successful completion, it stores the action sequence in Redis for next time.

Social Memory Summarizer:

When the WebApp receives a request for dialogue (/agent/interact), this module is called first.

It retrieves the relationship status and a summary of recent events from PostgreSQL/Redis.

It constructs a compressed context string. This string, rather than dozens of raw memories, is then used in the final prompt to the LLM.

4. Client-Side Architecture (Phaser 3)

The client is responsible for rendering the game world and capturing player input.

Scene Management: The game will be structured into multiple scenes for modularity.

PreloaderScene: Loads all necessary game assets (images, atlases, tilemaps).

MainMenuScene: Handles main menu UI, login/character selection.

GameScene: The main game world where gameplay occurs. It will render players, NPCs, and the tilemap.

UIScene: Renders all UI elements on top of the GameScene (e.g., chat, inventory, dialogue boxes). This keeps UI logic separate from game logic.

Networking:

The client will use the official colyseus.js SDK.

On joining the GameScene, the client will connect to the Colyseus server: const room = await client.joinOrCreate("heartwood_room");.

The client will listen for state patches from the server (room.onStateChange) and update the positions and animations of players and NPCs accordingly.

Player input (e.g., key presses for movement) will be sent to the server for validation: room.send("move", { x, y });.

State Management: Client-side state (e.g., player inventory) will be a combination of data received from the server and local state. For simplicity, we will use plain JavaScript objects and custom event emitters before introducing a formal state management library.

5. Server-Side Architecture

5.1. Game Server (Colyseus)

The Game Server handles the real-time multiplayer logic.

Room Definition (HeartwoodRoom.ts):

A single room type will manage one game instance (a single farm/town area).

State Schema: The room's state will be defined using @colyseus/schema for automatic binary patching.

class Player extends Schema { @type("string") name: string; @type("number") x: number; @type("number") y: number; }
class NPC extends Schema { @type("string") characterId: string; @type("number") x: number; @type.("number") y: number; }
class HeartwoodRoomState extends Schema { @type({ map: Player }) players = new MapSchema<Player>(); @type({ map: NPC }) npcs = new MapSchema<NPC>(); }

Lifecycle Hooks:

onCreate(): Initialize the room, load NPC data from the database.

onJoin(): Authorize the player, create a Player schema instance, and add them to the state.

onMessage(): Handle incoming messages from clients (e.g., "move", "chat"). This is where server-authoritative logic lives.

onLeave(): Remove the player from the state.

5.2. Web API (Node.js / Express)

This server handles all HTTP-based communication.

Authentication:

POST /auth/login: Accepts credentials, returns a JSON Web Token (JWT).

POST /auth/register: Creates a new user in the PostgreSQL database.

LLM Proxy:

POST /npc/interact: This is the crucial endpoint for conversations.

Receives { npcId: string, message: string } from the client with a valid JWT.

It will not call the LLM API directly. Instead, it will publish a job to a Redis queue.

A separate worker process will consume jobs from this queue, construct the prompt, call the LLM API, and store the result. This prevents the API from being a blocking bottleneck.

Middleware: All protected routes will use JWT middleware to authenticate the user.

6. Generative Agent Architecture

This system implements the full generative agent architecture as described in the research papers, creating truly autonomous NPCs with emergent behaviors.

5.1. Agent Memory Stream

Each agent maintains a comprehensive memory stream consisting of:

Observations: Real-time perceptions of the environment, other agents, and players
- "I see Bob approaching the blacksmith shop"
- "Alice is talking to the merchant about wheat prices"
- "The sun is setting, most people are heading home"

Reflections: High-level insights generated from observations
- "Alice seems worried about the harvest this year"
- "Bob has been visiting me more often lately"
- "The town feels more tense since the merchant shortage"

Plans: Goal-oriented action sequences
- "I should finish this horseshoe before dinner"
- "I want to ask Bob about his mining concerns"
- "I need to restock iron before the festival"

5.2. Memory Retrieval and Synthesis

Vector-based retrieval using embeddings to find relevant memories based on:
- Semantic similarity to current situation
- Recency weighting for fresh memories
- Importance scoring for significant events
- Emotional relevance to agent's current state

5.3. Agent Reflection System

Periodic reflection process that:
- Analyzes patterns in recent observations
- Generates insights about relationships and situations
- Updates agent's understanding of social dynamics
- Influences future behavior and decision-making

5.4. Agent Planning System

Goal-directed behavior through:
- Daily routine planning (work, meals, social time)
- Reactive planning for unexpected events
- Social goal formation (strengthening relationships, pursuing interests)
- Adaptive replanning based on outcomes

5.5. Agent Metacognition System

Introspective capabilities for:
- Performance evaluation of past actions
- Strategy adjustment based on outcomes
- Goal prioritization and modification
- Self-awareness of emotional states and preferences

5.6. Agent Scheduling and Coordination

Dynamic scheduling that handles:
- Individual agent routines and preferences
- Social coordination for group activities
- Interruption handling for player interactions
- Emergent social events and gatherings

5.7. Prompt Construction for Agentic Behavior

When agents need to make decisions or respond, prompts include:

Agent Constitution: Core personality, goals, and behavioral patterns
Current Context: Immediate environment, people present, time of day
Relevant Memories: Retrieved from memory stream based on current situation
Active Plans: Current goals and intended actions
Emotional State: Mood, energy level, social needs
Metacognitive Insights: Self-awareness and strategic considerations

Example prompt structure:
```
You are Elara, a thoughtful blacksmith in Heartwood Valley. You love your craft and flowers, but dislike loud noises and crowds. You're concerned about the town's economy but try to stay optimistic.

Current Situation: It's 3 PM, you're in your smithy. Bob approaches looking worried.

Relevant Memories:
- Bob mentioned dangerous mine conditions yesterday
- You've been working on a horseshoe for his cart
- Bob has been visiting more often lately, possibly interested in you romantically

Current Plans:
- Finish the horseshoe before dinner
- Ask Bob about his mining concerns
- Close shop at 5 PM for evening walk

Emotional State: Focused but open to conversation, slightly worried about Bob's safety

Metacognitive Insight: You've noticed Bob seems to need someone to talk to about his work stress. Being a good listener might strengthen your friendship.

Given this context, how do you respond to Bob's approach?
```

Memory Management:

Observations are continuously stored as embeddings in the vector database
Reflections are generated daily and during significant events
Plans are updated based on outcomes and new information
All interactions update the memory stream with new observations
Long-term memories are periodically consolidated and summarized

Cost/Rate Limiting: 
- Intelligent batching of reflection generation
- Efficient memory retrieval to minimize LLM calls
- Adaptive detail levels based on situation importance
- Caching of recent decisions and responses

8. Key Data Flows

8.1. Player Movement

Client: User presses 'W'. Client sends room.send("move", "up").

Game Server (Colyseus): onMessage("move") is triggered. The server validates if the move is legal (e.g., not into a wall).

Game Server: If valid, updates the player's x, y in the room state.

All Clients: The colyseus.js SDK receives the state patch. The onStateChange listener fires, and the player model is updated to the new coordinates.

Agent Management System: Observes player movement and updates agent memory streams with new observations.

8.2. Agent Autonomous Behavior

Agent Scheduling System: Checks current time against agent schedules and active plans.

Agent Management System: Identifies agents that need to take actions or make decisions.

Agent Memory System: Retrieves relevant memories based on current context and situation.

Agent Planning System: Determines appropriate actions based on goals, schedule, and environmental context.

LLM Worker: Processes agent decision-making with full contextual prompt including memories, plans, and metacognitive insights.

Agent Management System: Executes the decided action (movement, interaction, activity change).

Game Server: Updates agent positions and states in the world.

All Clients: Receive agent state updates and display autonomous NPC behaviors.

8.3. Agent-Agent Interactions

Agent A: Approaches Agent B based on social goals or scheduled activities.

Agent Management System: Detects proximity and initiates inter-agent interaction.

Agent Memory System: Retrieves relevant memories about the relationship and past interactions.

Agent Planning System: Both agents consider their goals and how this interaction fits their plans.

LLM Worker: Processes conversation flow with full context for both agents.

Agent Management System: Updates relationship states and memory streams for both agents.

Game Server: Broadcasts interaction states to all clients.

All Clients: Display agent-to-agent conversation and behavioral changes.

8.4. Agent Memory and Reflection

Agent Memory System: Continuously monitors for significant events, interactions, and observations.

Agent Memory System: Stores new observations as embeddings in Vector Database.

Agent Reflection System: Periodically analyzes memory patterns and generates insights.

LLM Worker: Processes reflection generation with memory stream analysis.

Agent Memory System: Stores reflections and updates agent understanding.

Agent Planning System: Adjusts future plans based on new reflections and insights.

8.5. Agent Metacognitive Processing

Agent Metacognition System: Monitors agent performance and goal achievement.

Agent Metacognition System: Evaluates recent actions and their outcomes.

LLM Worker: Processes metacognitive analysis with performance data.

Agent Management System: Updates agent strategies and goal priorities.

Agent Planning System: Modifies future planning based on metacognitive insights.

8.6. Player-Agent Conversation

Client: Player types "Hello Elara" and hits send. Client makes an authenticated POST /agent/interact call to the Web API.

Web API: The API validates the request, checks rate limits, and queues the interaction.

Agent Management System: Notifies the target agent of the player interaction.

Agent Memory System: Retrieves relevant memories about the player and current context.

Agent Planning System: Considers how this interaction fits current goals and plans.

LLM Worker: Processes the conversation with full agent context (memories, plans, emotional state, metacognitive insights).

Agent Management System: Updates agent memory with the new interaction and any resulting plan changes.

Game Server: Sends the response back to the client and updates agent state.

Client: Receives the message from Colyseus and displays the agent's response in the dialogue UI.

8.7. Agent Scheduling and Coordination

Agent Scheduling System: Manages individual agent schedules and identifies conflicts.

Agent Coordination System: Resolves conflicts when multiple agents want to use the same space or resource.

Agent Management System: Coordinates group activities and social events.

Agent Planning System: Adjusts individual plans based on coordination needs.

Game Server: Updates agent positions and activities based on coordinated plans.

All Clients: Display coordinated agent behaviors and group activities.

8.8. Updated Data Flow Example: Agent Makes Breakfast

Agent Manager: It's 8 AM. Triggers agent "Elara" to perform her "make breakfast" routine. It calls the PlanningSystem.

Affordability System (Intercepts): Before the PlanningSystem calls the LLM, the AffordabilitySystem checks Redis for lifestyle_policy:elara:make_breakfast.

Cache Hit: A policy exists! The system returns the cached action sequence: ["walk to kitchen", "open fridge", "get eggs", "cook on stove"].

Agent Manager: Receives the plan without any LLM call and sends the actions to the GameServer for execution.

Result: The agent makes breakfast with zero LLM cost.

This integrated architecture provides a clear and robust path to building the highly intelligent, adaptive, and efficient agents you envision.

9. Deployment & Operations (DevOps)

Containerization: The entire stack (Web API, Game Server, Agent Systems, Databases) will be defined in a docker-compose.yml file for easy local development setup.

CI/CD: A GitHub Actions workflow will be set up. On a push to the main branch, it will:

Run tests for all services including agent behavior tests.

Build Docker images for the Web API, Game Server, and Agent Management System.

Push images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

Trigger a deployment on the cloud host to pull the new images and restart the services.

Monitoring: Use a process manager like PM2 for Node.js applications. Integrate a logging service (e.g., Datadog, Logtail) to aggregate logs from all services for easier debugging.

Agent-Specific Monitoring:
- Agent behavior metrics (actions per minute, interaction frequency)
- Memory system performance (retrieval latency, reflection generation time)
- LLM API usage and costs per agent
- Agent coordination conflicts and resolution times
- Metacognitive processing queue lengths and processing times

Scaling Considerations:
- Horizontal scaling of Agent Management System for large populations
- Vector database clustering for memory storage
- Redis clustering for real-time agent coordination
- Load balancing for LLM API calls across multiple providers
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed agent memories
