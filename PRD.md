# Product Requirements Document

**Project: Heartwood Valley**
**Current Status: Advanced Prototype with Core AI Systems Fully Operational**

## 1. Introduction & Vision

Project Heartwood Valley is a multiplayer, 2D pixel-art life and farming simulation game for web browsers that features the world's first fully autonomous generative agents as NPCs. Inspired by breakthrough research in "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior" and "Metacognition is all you need? Using Introspection in Generative Agents to Improve Goal-directed Behavior", this game creates a living, breathing small town where NPCs have their own memories, schedules, goals, and relationships.

The core vision is to create a persistent social simulation where autonomous agents live authentic lives - working, socializing, pursuing goals, and forming relationships with each other and players. These agents remember every interaction, reflect on their experiences, plan for the future, and adapt their behavior based on outcomes. Players enter this world as newcomers to a town that continues to exist and evolve even when they're not playing, creating unprecedented emergent storytelling and social dynamics.

**Current Achievement**: The core AI agent architecture has been successfully implemented and is operational, featuring 24 autonomous NPCs with full cognitive architectures including advanced memory systems, reflection capabilities, metacognitive evaluation, dynamic planning, and sophisticated activity management systems.

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary Audience (The AI Enthusiast)**: Ages 22-40. Tech-savvy individuals fascinated by artificial intelligence, emergent behavior, and autonomous systems. They are drawn to witnessing and interacting with the first truly agentic NPCs in gaming. They want to explore the boundaries of AI behavior and be part of a groundbreaking social simulation experience. They are active on platforms like Discord, Reddit, and AI communities.

**Secondary Audience (The Social Simulation Lover)**: Ages 18-35. Fans of life simulation games (Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, The Sims) who crave deeper, more meaningful social interactions. They are looking for authentic relationship-building experiences and emergent storytelling that goes beyond scripted content. They value character development, community building, and narrative depth.

**Tertiary Audience (The Competitive Strategist)**: Ages 20-40. Players who enjoy optimization, social strategy, and competitive game mechanics. They are motivated by understanding agent behavior patterns, achieving unique relationship outcomes, and mastering complex social systems. They will be drawn to the challenge of building meaningful relationships with autonomous agents.
