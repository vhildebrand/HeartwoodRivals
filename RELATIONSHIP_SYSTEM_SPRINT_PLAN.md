# Sprint Plan: Competitive Social & Relationship System

## 1. High-Level Roadmap

This document details the sprint-by-sprint plan for implementing the **Competitive Social & Relationship System**. The project is broken down into six sprints, starting with foundational backend work and progressively building up to full AI integration and player-facing features.

*   **Sprint 1: Foundation & Data Models**: Laying the groundwork in the database and creating core manager services.
*   **Sprint 2: The Witness & Reputation System**: Making NPCs passive observers of the social world and building the public reputation system.
*   **Sprint 3: The Gossip System**: Introducing active player influence through gossip and social manipulation.
*   **Sprint 4: The Romantic Contention Model**: Implementing the core AI state machine that governs NPC romantic decision-making.
*   **Sprint 5: AI-Driven Behavior & Planning**: Translating AI strategies into observable, in-game NPC actions and quests.
*   **Sprint 6: Polish, Balancing & Player Experience**: Tuning the system for fairness, fun, and intuitive gameplay.
