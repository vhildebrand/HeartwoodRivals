### Deliverable Achievement
**"An agent will autonomously execute a hard-coded plan at the correct time."**

This deliverable is achieved through:
1. **Schedule Loading**: Agents load pre-defined schedules from JSON files
2. **Time-Based Execution**: Actions execute at exact scheduled times
3. **Plan Processing**: Different action types (work, move, eat, sleep) handled correctly
4. **State Management**: Agents transition between states appropriately
5. **Visual Feedback**: Client displays agent actions and state changes

## Testing Instructions

### Setup
1. Start Docker environment: `docker-compose up`
2. Ensure all services are running (game-server, web-api, database, redis)
3. Open client in browser: `http://localhost:5173`

### Manual Testing
1. **Time Observation**: Watch game time advance in real-time
2. **Agent Spawning**: Verify agents appear at correct locations
3. **Schedule Execution**: Observe agents following their schedules
4. **Movement**: Watch agents move between locations
5. **Coordination**: Check multiple agents don't conflict

### Automated Testing
1. Run game server tests: `npm test` (if implemented)
2. Check console logs for agent system messages
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Verify database updates

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation Limitations
1. **Simplified Database**: Using mock database interface instead of full PostgreSQL
2. **Basic Pathfinding**: No advanced pathfinding optimizations
3. **Limited AI**: No LLM integration for decision-making (future sprints)
4. **Simple Coordination**: Basic conflict prevention without complex negotiation

### Future Enhancements (Sprint 4+)
1. **LLM Integration**: Agents generate their own plans using AI
2. **Advanced Pathfinding**: Multi-agent pathfinding with cooperation
3. **Complex Interactions**: Agent-to-agent and agent-to-player conversations
4. **Dynamic Scheduling**: Agents modify schedules based on circumstances

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 successfully implements autonomous agent behavior with:
- ✅ **Time-based scheduling** working correctly
- ✅ **Pathfinding and movement** functioning smoothly  
- ✅ **State management** handling all agent states
- ✅ **Coordination** preventing conflicts
- ✅ **Client integration** displaying agent behavior

The system provides a solid foundation for future sprints to build upon, with agents now capable of executing pre-defined plans at the correct times in a coordinated, visually appealing manner.
