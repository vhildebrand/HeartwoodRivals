He chose Beacon Bay as his home base because he believes small communities can be laboratories for positive change. He's funded everything from the school's computer lab to the harbor's sustainability initiatives. He prefers to work behind the scenes, often providing anonymous donations. He lives simply despite his wealth and is known for his surprise visits to local businesses and community events.",
