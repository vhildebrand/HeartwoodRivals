  "background": "Coach Jason moved to Beacon Bay three years ago to escape the high-pressure fitness industry in the city. He fell in love with the coastal lifestyle and opened his gym to help locals stay fit and healthy. He's particularly passionate about helping maritime workers maintain their physical health given the demanding nature of their jobs. He lives in a small apartment above the gym and is often seen running on the beach at sunrise.",
