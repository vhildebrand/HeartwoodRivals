She was drawn to the town's natural rhythm and the way ocean sounds could be incorporated into electronic music. She's transformed the DJ stage into a premier entertainment venue and regularly hosts events that bring the whole community together. She lives in a converted shipping container near the beach that she's turned into a mobile studio.",
