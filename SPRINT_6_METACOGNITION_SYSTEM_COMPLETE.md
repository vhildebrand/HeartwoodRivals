### **2. Strategic Evaluation System**
- **‚úÖ LLM-Based Self-Assessment**: Agents generate detailed performance evaluations
- **‚úÖ Strategy Adjustment**: Identification of areas for improvement
- **‚úÖ Goal Modification**: Dynamic updating of goals based on insights
- **‚úÖ Self-Awareness Development**: Agents recognize their own patterns and behaviors

### **3. Dynamic Schedule Modification**
- **‚úÖ Schedule Override System**: Metacognitive insights can modify daily schedules
- **‚úÖ Priority-Based Integration**: Schedule modifications integrate with existing planning system
- **‚úÖ Reason-Based Changes**: All schedule modifications include clear reasoning
- **‚úÖ Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all schedule changes

### **4. Conversation-Driven Metacognition**
- **‚úÖ Player Interaction Triggers**: Conversations can trigger metacognitive evaluations
- **‚úÖ Opportunity Detection**: System detects new opportunities mentioned by players
- **‚úÖ Context-Aware Responses**: Metacognitive system considers conversation context
- **‚úÖ Sarah/Seeds Example**: Implemented the specific use case from requirements

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Components**

#### **1. MetacognitionProcessor - The Strategic Brain**
```typescript
export class MetacognitionProcessor {
  // Continuous processing of metacognitive evaluations
  public async startProcessing(): Promise<void>
  
  // Evaluate agent performance and generate insights
  public async evaluateAgentPerformance(agent_id: string, trigger_reason: string): Promise<void>
  
  // Apply schedule modifications based on metacognitive insights
  private async applyScheduleModifications(agent_id: string, modifications: ScheduleModification[]): Promise<void>
}
```

#### **2. Dynamic Schedule System**
```typescript
interface ScheduleModification {
  time: string;           // When to perform the activity
  activity: string;       // What activity to perform
  description: string;    // Detailed description
  reason: string;         // Why this change is needed
  priority: number;       // Priority level (1-10)
}
```

#### **3. Integration with Memory System**
```typescript
// High-importance memories trigger metacognitive evaluation
if (memory.importance_score >= 8) {
  await this.triggerMetacognitionCheck(memory.agent_id);
}
```

### **API Endpoints**

#### **Testing and Monitoring**
- **POST /metacognition/trigger** - Manually trigger metacognitive evaluation
- **GET /metacognition/queue-status** - Monitor processing queue
- **GET /metacognition/stats** - Overall system statistics
- **GET /metacognition/history/{agentId}** - Agent's metacognitive history
- **GET /metacognition/schedule-modifications/{agentId}** - Schedule changes
- **POST /metacognition/conversation-trigger** - Conversation-based trigger
- **POST /metacognition/sarah-seeds-example** - Test the specific example

## üìä **Example: Sarah's Seeds Metacognitive Process**

### **Input Scenario**
Player tells Sarah: "I heard there are some really good seeds available at the mansion that could help with your salt-resistant crops!"

### **Metacognitive Evaluation Process**
1. **Memory Analysis**: System reviews Sarah's recent experiences with crop failures
2. **Goal Assessment**: Evaluates progress toward "Develop salt-resistant crop varieties"
3. **Opportunity Recognition**: Identifies the mansion seeds as a strategic opportunity
4. **Schedule Analysis**: Reviews current schedule for optimization opportunities

### **Generated Metacognitive Insight**
```json
{
  "performance_evaluation": "I've been struggling with my salt-resistant crop development, and my current varieties aren't performing well. A player mentioned excellent seeds at the mansion that could help solve this problem.",
  "strategy_adjustments": ["Prioritize acquiring new seed varieties", "Investigate mansion seed sources"],
  "schedule_modifications": [
    {
      "time": "14:00",
      "activity": "travel",
      "description": "visit mansion to investigate seed varieties",
      "reason": "Player mentioned excellent seeds that could help with salt-resistant crop development",
      "priority": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Schedule Modification Result**
- **Original 14:00**: "afternoon field work"
- **Modified 14:00**: "visit mansion to investigate seed varieties"
- **Reason**: Player mentioned excellent seeds that could help with salt-resistant crop development
- **Priority**: 9 (high priority due to goal relevance)

## üéÆ **Player Experience**

### **Observable Behaviors**
1. **Dynamic Schedule Changes**: NPCs visibly change their routines based on player conversations
2. **Goal-Oriented Responses**: Agents reference their strategic thinking in conversations
3. **Opportunity Pursuit**: NPCs actively seek out opportunities mentioned by players
4. **Strategic Adaptation**: Agents adjust their approaches based on outcomes

### **Example Conversation Flow**
```
Before Metacognition:
Player: "There are good seeds at the mansion"
Sarah: "That's interesting. I'm focused on my field work right now."

After Metacognition:
Player: "There are good seeds at the mansion"
Sarah: "Really? I've been having trouble with salt-resistant varieties. 
       I should investigate those seeds - they might be exactly what I need!"
[Sarah's schedule changes to visit mansion at 14:00]
```
